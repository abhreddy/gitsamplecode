Subject: Successful Upgradation Activity Completion After Overcoming Numerous Challenges

Hello Wayne,

	I am writing to provide an update on the recent upgradation activity that we have  successfully completed despite facing various challenges along the way.

We have now accomplished the upgradation activity and have achieved the desired outcomes. The upgraded application url is now fully operational and running efficiently.

Throughout the process, we faced the following key challenges:

1) We have faced permission issues and ownership issues for the software folder which is under backup and its impacted for extracting the jar files
2) unable to extract the jdk due to permission issues
3) In the environement we have two users one is aquadev and aquatest and with only user aquadev its working but with another aquatest faced issues with permission
4) space issue with the /tmp folder 

After co-ordination with unix team we have resolved all the issues 

Looking ahead, we are confident that the upgradation will bring substantial benefits to our organization and its operations.

Please let us know if any  further information required

I look forward to sharing more positive updates in the future.

Best regards,
Abhiram M
